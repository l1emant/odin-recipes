    <h2>Instructions for preparing Pizza</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: Pour water into the bowl of an electric mixer. <br />Add
        sugar and yeast; stir until yeast has dissolved. Let stand until foamy,
        about 5 minutes. <br />Add oil, flours, and salt. Fit mixer with paddle
        attachment; mix until combined. Switch <br />
        to dough hook; mix 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly floured
        surface, and knead a few <br />
        times with floured hands until smooth and elastic. Transfer dough to a
        large oiled bowl, <br />
        and turn to coat; cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm,
        draft-free place until doubled in bulk, <br />
        about 3 hours. (Alternatively, let dough rise in the refrigerator
        overnight.)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Pulse tomatoes in a blender until smooth; set aside. Put
        garlic and oil into a medium <br />
        saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until garlic sizzles,
        about 40 seconds. Add shallots; <br />
        cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar. Reduce
        heat to medium-low. <br />
        Simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool
        slightly. <br />
        (Sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 3 days.)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Preheat a baking sheet. Punch down dough;
        transfer to a floured work surface. <br />
        Divide dough in half. Set half aside, and cover with plastic wrap. Roll
        out remaining dough to 14 by 7 inches, <br />
        1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour, and
        place rolled dough on top.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Brush top of dough lightly with oil. Spread with 1/2 cup sauce, leaving
        a 1/2-inch border. Top with half <br />
        the mozzarella. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan, and season with
        pepper.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Slide pizza onto heated sheet in oven. Bake until dough is golden and
        cheese is bubbling, 10 to 12 minutes. <br />
        Meanwhile, repeat process with remaining dough. Let each pizza cool
        slightly; top with half the basil. <br />
        Cut into slices, and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
