    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together eggs, cream, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a
        medium bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place bread in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold bread slices
        in a single layer. <br />
        Pour egg mixture over bread; soak 10 minutes. <br />
        Turn slices over; soak until soaked through, about 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet, and
        set aside. <br />
        Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet
        over medium heat. <br />
        Fry half the bread slices until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

        skillet, <br />
